# Abstract
In today’s date, most people will go online and research about products, companies before they make a purchase. Any business that does not have a website is missing out on one of the most powerful marketing tools available to them. The main reason for any businesses to have a website is so that people can easily find you online.  For this reason of online dependency, we develop a Database management system of a website for a Fitness Center in which customer can get all information about the Fitness Center and they can access or enroll at the Fitness Center via online. Usually, the client uses MS Excel or paper, and maintains their records, however it is not possible for them to share the data from multiple system in multi user environment, there is lot of duplicate work, and chance of mistake. When the records are changed they need to update each and every excel file.

The Smart Fitness Management System eliminates most of the limitations of the existing software. Increasing efficiency and effectiveness, automation, accuracy, user-friendly interface, information availability, communication capacity, maintenance, cost reduction makes our system smarter than the existing system.
